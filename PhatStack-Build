# Detailed information is available on the Pimoroni github repo for all the installation scripts used below - https://github.com/pimoroni
# All I did here was bolt together all the amazing work already done by the team at Pimoroni, so all credit goes to them
# If some of you are nervous about running some of the bash based installation scripts, Pimoroni provide full details on github
# If you want to see the script without executing, remove the | bash section at the end i.e. "curl -sS https://get.pimoroni.com/speakerphat"
# Check Disk Space
df -h

# Check latest versions are up to date
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

# Install Speaker Phat and Pivumeter
curl -sS https://get.pimoroni.com/speakerphat | bash
# Run tests and confirm all drivers installed
/home/pi/Pimoroni/speakerphat/test/test.sh

sudo python /home/pi/Pimoroni/scrollphathd/examples/clock.py
# Please note I got a flask error at this point so had to run - sudo pip install flask - which resolved the issue

# then I installed Blinkt to cover the gap at the bottom of the board until my female header arrived for my PiZero, which I'll fit and update
curl https://get.pimoroni.com/blinkt | bash
